# COVID-19-Exploratory-Data-Analysis
This is my first proper repository. It as an Exploratroy Data Analysis of the COVID-19 Pandemic dataset, which helped us gain insights on the demographics and trends for all the countries around the world. It is very raw and not the cleanest of all but it gives basic information. 

I have used various python libraries for the graphs of COVID-19 trends in India and have used Tableau to create a Dashboaard represeting various aspects of the COVID-19 data of the world.
